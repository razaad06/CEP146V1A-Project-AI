## The Risk-Based Approach

The law sorts AI into four categories based on how dangerous it could be:

### 1. Unacceptable Risk (BANNED)
- Social scoring systems (like China's)
- AI that manipulates human behavior
- Real-time facial recognition in public (with some police exceptions)
- Emotion recognition in schools and workplaces

### 2. High Risk (STRICT RULES)
- AI in hiring and employment decisions
- AI in healthcare/medical devices
- AI in education (grading, admissions)
- AI in law enforcement
- AI in critical infrastructure

**Requirements**: Human oversight, transparency, accuracy testing, documentation

### 3. Limited Risk (TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED)
- Chatbots (must tell users they're talking to AI)
- AI-generated content (must be labeled)
- Deepfakes (must be disclosed)

### 4. Minimal Risk (NO RESTRICTIONS)
- Spam filters
- Video game AI
- Most everyday AI applications

## Why Does This Matter Globally?

### The "Brussels Effect"
- Any company selling AI products in the EU must comply
- This includes Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta
- Companies often apply EU rules worldwide (easier than different rules per region)
- GDPR did the same thing for privacy—now EU standards are global standards

| High-risk violations | €15 million or 3% of global revenue |
| Providing false info | €7.5 million or 1% of global revenue |
