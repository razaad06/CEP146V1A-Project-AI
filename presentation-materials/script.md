# THE EU AI ACT SCRIPT
tried to make it roughly 3 minutes in recording time and summarized


## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Raza Speaking**

"What's up everyone, today we're talking about something that's going to affect every major tech company in the world and probably change how AI gets built everywhere. It's called the EU AI Act, and it's the first comprehensive law ever made to regulate artificial intelligence."


## SLIDE 2: What Is the EU AI Act?
**Raza Speaking**

"So what is it? The EU AI Act is a law passed by the European Union in March 2024. It officially went into effect on August 1st, 2024. Think of it like a rulebook for AI. It tells companies what they can and can't do with artificial intelligence and the penalties for breaking these rules can reach up to 35 million euros, or 7% of a company's global revenue. That's A LOT of money."


## SLIDE 3: The Risk-Based Approach
**Raza Speaking**

"The way the law works is through a risk-based system. AI gets sorted into four categories. First, there's unacceptable risk, like this stuff is completely banned. We're talking about things like social scoring systems, where governments rate citizens based on behavior, or AI designed to manipulate people. Real-time facial recognition in public is also banned, with very limited exceptions for law enforcement.

Then there's high-risk AI things like AI used in hiring decisions, healthcare, or education. These aren't banned, but they have to meet strict requirements for transparency and human oversight."


## SLIDE 4: Limited & Minimal Risk
**Raza Speaking**

"For limited-risk AI, like chatbots, the main rule is transparency. If you're talking to an AI, you have to be told it's an AI. Deepfakes need to be labeled. And then there's minimal-risk AI—stuff like spam filters or video game characters which basically has no restrictions at all."


## SLIDE 5: Why This Matters Globally
**Raza Speaking**

"Here's the main reason why this is HUGE: this isn't just a European issue. Any company that wants to sell AI products in Europe has to follow these rules. That means Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, all of them. And most companies don't want to build two different versions of their products, so they'll probably just follow EU rules everywhere. This is called the 'Brussels Effect.' It's the same thing that happened with GDPR—European privacy rules basically became the world standard."


## SLIDE 6: Future Implications
**Raza Speaking**

"Looking ahead, we're probably gonna see other countries follow Europe's lead. The US is already talking about AI regulation, but there's also pushback because some people worry that too much regulation could slow down innovation and let countries like China get ahead in the AI race. It's a real tension between safety and competition."


## SLIDE 7: Conclusion & Discussion Question
**Raza Speaking**

"So to wrap everything up, should the EU AI Act is the first major attempt to create rules for artificial intelligence. It bans the most dangerous uses, regulates high-risk applications, and is already influencing how AI gets built worldwide. 

And that brings us to our discussion question..."

"Should governments regulate AI, or should tech companies be trusted to regulate themselves?"
